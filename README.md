The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the prices of mobile phones based on key features. By conducting a comprehensive feature extraction analysis, we aim to identify and prioritize the most influential factors affecting mobile phone pricing in the current competitive market. This insight will enable our organization to enhance its pricing strategy, optimize product offerings, and improve overall market competitiveness.
This dataset contains detailed information about various mobile phones, including their model, color, memory, RAM, battery capacity, rear camera specifications, front camera specifications, presence of AI lens, mobile height, processor, and, most importantly, the price. Our primary goal is to develop a predictive model for mobile phone prices.
